### Links

## My process

Read all project prerequisites and took a look at the example stock website. Proceeded to search online for other inspiration from company homepages and then started to build out the HTML. Following the HTML, CSS and CSS reset files were built out. After the CSS and imports from other sites for fonts / images, media queries were added to account for responsiveness.
 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to further implement flexbox and change the presentation of elements according to media screen size.
